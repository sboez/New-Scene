# New-Scene

![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/sboez/New-Scene) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/three.js-r132-orange">

This repo was made for my Three.js projects, this is how they begins, with a simple scene.
As I'm often working with 3D models, I added FBX and GLTF Loader and a GUI to set the model easier.

# Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sboez/New-Scene.git
```

```shell
npm install
```

```shell
npm run dev
```

You're ready to create your world :sparkles:
