# New-Scene

![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/sboez/New-Scene) <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/three.js-r112-informational">

This repo was made for my Three.js projects, this is how they begins, with a simple scene.
As I'm working often with 3D models, I added FBX and GLTF Loader.

# Usage

`git clone https://github.com/sboez/New-Scene.git`  


`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`  


Go to localhost:8000 and create your world :sparkles:
