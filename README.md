This repo was made for my Three.js projects, this is how they begins, with a simple scene.
As I'm often working with 3D models, I added FBX and GLTF Loader and a GUI to set the model or mesh easier.

# Usage

```shell
git clone https://github.com/sboez/New-Scene.git
```

```shell
npm i 
```

```shell
npm run start
```
